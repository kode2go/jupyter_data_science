# EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

Today we will cover the three most widely used plots you will come across, that is line plot, scatter, and bar plots.

Its gonna be fairly introductory. In data visualizations and data visualtions types. But we will do it on realistic data.

That is what I personally find interesting. Seoul public bike sharing data. They have public bike sharing system in seoul. And this data set gives us info every day of every hour 2017-2018 public bikes been rented out by people and we will see relationships (NB) between bike sharing and specific weathther conditions as there are weather data on an hourly basis as well. So its gonna be really great data to visualise as we really want to try to find trends and relationships. Some things that are obvious, some things maybe not. And this drives decision making, business etc.

The primary goal is to find these relationships and we do this through data visualisations, line plots, scatter plots and bar plots.

And secondary goal, which visualisations make sense in which situations. So if you have tabular data on hand, with various columns some are categorical, some are continuous (remember the data-viz.comd site I showed before..., these are terms you will get to do more in stats next week), some are time based etc. So different situations you have different combinations you have different visualisations to take advantage of.
